          <h3>1.1 Information you provide directly</h3>

          <p>
            When you book a consultation call through our calendar widget or
            contact us through the website, we collect:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>email address</strong> so we
              can confirm the meeting and send the Google Meet link and
              calendar invite.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phone number</strong> (optional) if you provide one on
              the booking form so we can reach you if the Meet link fails or
              you request a phone call instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Notes about your business</strong> (optional) that you
              add to the booking form to help us prepare for the call.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            When you call our AI voice agent at{' '}
            {HAS_REAL_PHONE ? AGENT_PHONE_DISPLAY : '(the number will be posted here once live)'},
            we collect:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Your voice input</strong> (converted to text by our
              speech-to-text provider and processed by our AI voice model).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The full call recording</strong> and{' '}
              <strong>text transcript</strong> for quality assurance and
              product improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Caller ID / phone number</strong> as delivered by the
              telephone network.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any <strong>business information</strong> you share during the
              conversation (industry, business name, call volume, etc.).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>

          <p>
            When you visit implenix.net, we collect (via Google Analytics 4,
            Google Tag Manager, and Vercel infrastructure):
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Browser type, operating system, and device type</li>
            <li>
              IP address (truncated for privacy where required by law) and
              approximate geographic location (city / region / country)
            </li>
            <li>
              Pages visited, time on page, referring URL, and click-through
              paths
            </li>
            <li>
              Interactions with specific elements — for example, clicking
              the phone-agent CTA, submitting a booking, or opening the
              audit tool
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> collect financial information
            (credit card numbers, bank details) directly through the
            website. Any billing is handled through separate written
            agreements with contracted customers.
          </p>

          <h3>1.3 Information from third-party services</h3>

          <p>
            Where you interact with us through Google Calendar (booking a
            consultation), we receive limited information (your name and
            email) from Google as part of the calendar invitation flow.
            This is subject to Google's own privacy policies.
          </p>

          <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>

          <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>

              invites, Meet links, reminders, and (where you have opted in)
              follow-up communications about our services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operate the AI voice agent</strong> — respond to your
              call, capture intake, route escalations to a human, and log
              the interaction for our internal records.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improve the product</strong> — analyze aggregate
              website usage and (with call recordings) improve the quality
              of the AI voice agent's script and responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Provide customer support</strong> — respond to
              questions, troubleshoot issues, and resolve disputes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Comply with legal obligations</strong> — respond to
              lawful requests from regulators, comply with tax and
              accounting requirements, and enforce our Terms &amp;
              Conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prevent fraud and abuse</strong> — detect and prevent
              unauthorized access, security threats, and abuse of our
              services.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>3. Legal basis for processing (GDPR)</h2>

          <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the
            United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we process your personal data
            under the following legal bases:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Consent</strong> — when you actively book a call,
              call our agent, or interact with cookie-enabled tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contract</strong> — when we need to deliver services
              you have signed up for.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate interest</strong> — for operating and
              improving our website and services in ways that do not
              override your privacy rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal obligation</strong> — where we are required to
              retain records for tax or compliance reasons.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We use cookies and similar technologies for the following

          </p>

          <ul>

          </ul>

          <p>
            You can control cookies through your browser settings. For
            residents of the EU/UK, we will present a cookie consent

            We retain personal information only as long as we need it for
            the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Call recordings and transcripts</strong>: retained

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Website analytics data</strong>: retained as long as
              Google Analytics defaults require (currently up to 14 months
              for user-identifiable data).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business records</strong> (contracts, invoices,

          <p>
            Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights
            regarding your personal information:

            <li>
              <strong>Correction</strong> — request that we correct

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deletion</strong> ("right to be forgotten") —

              legal retention requirements.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdraw consent</strong> for any processing based on
              consent, without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lodge a complaint</strong> with a data protection
              authority in your jurisdiction (e.g., ICO in the UK, CNIL in
              France, state attorneys general in the US).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            To exercise these rights, contact us at the address in Section

          </p>

          <h2>8. International data transfers</h2>

          <p>
            Implenix is based in the United States. If you access our
            services from outside the United States, your information will
            be transferred to and processed in the United States. Some of
            our third-party service providers are also based in or process
            data in the United States and other jurisdictions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where required by law, we rely on European Commission Standard
            Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions, or other approved
            transfer mechanisms to safeguard cross-border transfers of
            personal data.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Children's privacy</h2>

          <p>
            Implenix services are not directed at children under the age
            of 16 (or 13 in the United States, per COPPA). We do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
            believe we have collected information from a child, please
            contact us at the address in Section 13 and we will delete it
            promptly.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Security</h2>

          <p>
            We implement commercially reasonable technical and
            organizational measures to protect your personal information —
            including encryption in transit (TLS), encryption at rest,
            role-based access controls, and audit logging. No security
            measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee absolute security
            of any information transmitted over the internet.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Automated decision-making and AI processing</h2>

          <p>
            Our AI voice agent uses automated processing to respond to
            callers, capture intake, and route calls. This processing does
            not produce legal or similarly significant effects on you —
