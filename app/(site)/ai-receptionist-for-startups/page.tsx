    'AI receptionist for startups. Qualify inbound leads, screen vendor pitches, and look like an established business, for $297/mo, no hire needed.',

const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'Why would a startup need an AI receptionist?',
    answer:
      'Startups deal with the same inbound problems established businesses have, lead qualification, partner inquiries, vendor solicitation noise, customer support routing, without the headcount or runway to hire a receptionist. The AI handles all of it for $297/month.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Doesn\'t a startup just use voicemail or a Google Voice number?',
    answer:
      'Most do, and most lose meaningful pipeline because of it. A B2B startup gets fewer inbound calls than a service business, but each one matters more, a partnership inquiry or a customer demo request that goes to voicemail rarely converts. The AI captures all of them.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will it screen out cold pitches and vendor solicitations?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Pattern-matched solicitations route to a callback queue your ops reviews weekly. Real prospect calls and partnership inquiries route to founders. This alone is worth the subscription for most startups.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can it integrate with our modern stack, HubSpot, Linear, Notion?',
    answer:
      'HubSpot, Salesforce, and most modern CRMs integrate natively. Linear and Notion integrations are configurable via webhook. We typically wire startup deployments end-to-end during onboarding.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does this make us "look established"?',
    answer:
      'A natural-sounding professional voice picking up your business number signals operational maturity. The agent runs your industry-specific intake, books real meetings, and delivers a brand-consistent experience on every call. Buyers and investors notice.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When should we switch to a real receptionist?',
    answer:
      'Most startups never need to. The AI scales with the business. Some hit a point where a brand-tier human receptionist becomes part of their positioning, at that point, the hybrid model (AI for volume, human for premium calls) typically wins.',
  },

              <p>
                Startups deal with a particular phone problem: lower
                inbound volume than a service business, but every call
                matters more. A partnership inquiry from someone who's
                already in your TAM. A customer prospect ready to demo.
                A late-stage candidate calling about the role. An
                investor warm-intro. Each one is high-stakes, and each
                one usually goes to voicemail because the founder is in
                a customer call, the team is in a sprint review, and no
                one has time to staff the phone.
              </p>
              <p>
                The traditional answer is to skip phones entirely, use
                a Slack channel for partners, an Intercom widget for
                customers, ATS for candidates. That works for some of
                the inbound, but every business eventually has phone
                calls coming in, and the ones that come in are
                disproportionately important. The other answer is hiring
                a receptionist or office manager, usually after Series
                A, often as overhead that doesn't scale linearly with
                the actual phone load.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implenix sits between those options. The AI takes every
                inbound call, runs your defined qualification logic
                (role, deal size, decision-maker, anti-fit signals),
                routes founders only the calls that need them, and
                screens out the rest. Cost is $297-$597/month flat.
                Setup is 7-14 days, no PBX or IT involvement. For most
                pre-Series-A startups, this is the right answer until
                you're large enough that a dedicated office manager
                makes sense, at which point the AI typically stays
                deployed for volume and the human role focuses on the
                premium calls.
