    'AI receptionist for small business owners. Answer every call while you work, book appointments 24/7, sync your CRM. Less than the cost of a part-time hire.',
  path: '/ai-receptionist-for-small-business',
});

const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'Is an AI receptionist worth it for a small business?',
    answer:
      'For any small business where missed calls cost real revenue, yes. A typical local-services SMB loses $5,000–$30,000 a month in unanswered calls. Implenix recovers most of that at a fixed monthly cost lower than a part-time hire.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this cheaper than hiring a receptionist?',
    answer:
      'A part-time receptionist runs $1,800–$2,400/month for 20 hours of coverage. A full-time hire runs $3,500–$5,000/month for 40 hours. Implenix starts at $297/month and covers all 168 hours in a week with no sick days, vacation, or turnover.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will it work for my industry?',
    answer:
      'We have shipped tuned playbooks for 25 industries — HVAC, plumbing, dental, real estate, law firms, salons, contractors, accountants, and more. Each one ships with industry-specific intake, transfer rules, and integrations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I am a solo operator. Will this work for me?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Solo operators are one of our most-served customer profiles — owners who are on a roof, in a chair, in a meeting, or otherwise unable to pick up. The Solo Operator plan starts at $297/month and includes 24/7 coverage and CRM sync.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does deployment take?',
    answer:
      '7 to 14 business days for most small businesses. We tune your script, voice, and integrations during onboarding, then run a parallel test period before cutting over real traffic.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my customers know they are talking to an AI?',
    answer:
      'For routine booking, qualification, and intake calls, most callers do not realize. For sensitive or emotionally complex calls, our live-transfer rules route to your phone in real time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can it handle after-hours calls?',
    answer:
      'Yes. After-hours coverage is included at the same fixed monthly cost. Most of our deployments see 30–50% of bookings come in outside business hours after the agent goes live.',
  },

              <p>
                Most small businesses are run by owners doing the actual work.
                A plumber is in a basement. A salon owner is mid-color. A
                contractor is on a roof. A solo accountant is in a client
                meeting. The phone rings during exactly the hours the owner
                cannot pick up — and the next caller goes to the next business
                on Google. Studies put the local-services missed-call rate at
                40-60% during business hours, and after hours it climbs near
                100%. Voicemail looks free; in practice it costs most SMBs
                $5,000-$30,000 a month in pipeline silently vanishing into
                voicemail boxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hiring a receptionist solves part of the problem at significant
                expense. A part-time receptionist runs $1,800-$2,400/month for
                20 hours of coverage. A full-time hire runs $3,500-$5,000/month
                for 40 hours. Both leave nights, weekends, and concurrent calls
                uncovered. Both come with HR overhead, training, sick days, and
                turnover. The math rarely works for an SMB until call volume
                is so high that the owner is already losing real revenue to
                the gaps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implenix is the AI receptionist for small business owners.
                It picks up within one ring, follows the script you tune
                during onboarding, books appointments directly into your
                calendar, and writes everything back to your CRM in real
                time. Coverage is 24/7. Concurrent capacity is unlimited.
                Cost is fixed at $297-$997/month regardless of call volume.
                For a solo operator running a service business on a phone
                that never quits, this is the most leveraged $300 on your
                P&L.
