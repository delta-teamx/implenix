          <h2>9. Warranties and disclaimers</h2>

          <p>
            The Website and free-tier Services are provided "
            <strong>AS IS</strong>" and "<strong>AS AVAILABLE</strong>"
            with no warranties of any kind, express or implied. Implenix
            disclaims all warranties including, but not limited to,
            warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, and non-infringement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Implenix does not warrant that the Website will be
            uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that defects will be
            corrected. Implenix does not warrant the accuracy,
            completeness, or reliability of any content on the Website —
            including case study numbers, industry averages, or audit
            calculator outputs.
          </p>

          <p>
            The AI voice agent consultation line is provided as a
            demonstration only. Implenix makes no representation that the
            agent will produce any specific outcome for your business.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>

          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Implenix
            and its affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, and
            agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without
            limitation loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other
            intangible losses, resulting from:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Your access to or use of the Website or Services;</li>
            <li>Your inability to access or use the Website or Services;</li>
            <li>
              Any content obtained from the Website or produced by the AI
              voice agent;
            </li>
            <li>
              Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions
              or content;
            </li>
            <li>
              Any bug, virus, or malicious software transmitted via the
              Website or Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In no event will Implenix's total aggregate liability arising
            out of or relating to these Terms or the Website exceed the
            greater of (a) the total fees paid by you to Implenix in the
            twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or
            (b) one hundred US dollars (<strong>US$100</strong>).
          </p>

          <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            certain warranties or liabilities, so some of the above
            limitations may not apply to you.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>

          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Implenix and
            its affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, and agents
            from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses,
            liabilities, costs, or expenses (including attorney's fees)
            arising from: (a) your use of and access to the Services;
            (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any
            third-party right, including without limitation any copyright,
            property, or privacy right.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Termination</h2>

          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your access to the Website or
            Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for
            any reason, including without limitation if you breach these
            Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Website and
            Services will immediately cease.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sections that by their nature should survive termination —
            including Intellectual Property, Warranties and Disclaimers,
            Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Governing Law —
            will survive termination.
          </p>

          <h2>13. Governing law and dispute resolution</h2>

          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
            United States, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
            Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
            Services will be resolved through binding arbitration
            administered by a mutually agreed arbitration provider in the
            State of Delaware, except that either party may seek
            injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction for
            infringement of intellectual property rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            You agree to resolve any dispute on an individual basis and
            not as a class or representative action, to the extent
            permitted by applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2>14. Modifications to these Terms</h2>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we
            do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of the
            page. For material changes, we will post a prominent notice on
            the Website. Your continued use of the Website or Services
            after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the
            revised Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>15. Miscellaneous</h2>

          <ul>

            <li>
              <strong>No waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce any right

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer
