const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'Is an AI receptionist worth it for a solo business?',
    answer:
      'Especially for solo operators. The bottleneck for any solo business is your own phone time. A typical solo operator loses 8–15 inbound calls a week to "I was on the job and couldn\'t pick up", and at average client values of $400-$3,000, that math justifies the AI inside the first few weeks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does this work when I\'m the only person in the business?',
    answer:
      'The AI is your virtual front desk. It picks up while you\'re on a job, books appointments against your calendar, captures leads to your CRM, and transfers urgent calls to your mobile per your defined rules. You stay on the work; the phone keeps closing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I afford this as a solo operator?',
    answer:
      'The Solo Operator plan is $297/month, typically less than the lost pipeline from a single missed booking call per month. For most solo trades, this is the most leveraged subscription on the P&L.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will it know how to handle my specific business?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We tune the script for your industry during onboarding. Plumbers, electricians, photographers, personal trainers, consultants, lawyers, therapists, each gets industry-specific intake, transfer rules, and integrations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I set this up alone, I don\'t have IT?',
    answer:
      'You don\'t need IT. We handle the technical setup during onboarding. You provide your phone number routing, calendar access, CRM access (if any), and approve the script. Live in 7-14 business days.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens when I\'m on vacation?',
    answer:
      'The agent runs continuously regardless. Every call gets answered, qualified, and either booked or held in a callback queue per your defined rules. You come back to a clean pipeline, not 47 voicemails.',
  },

                The defining constraint of any solo business is your own
                time. You're a one-person operation where every hour you
                spend on the phone is an hour you're not delivering work.
                Customers call when they need you, which is exactly when
                you're delivering work for someone else. The result is
                a familiar pattern: 8-15 missed calls a week, voicemail
                that costs more leads than it saves, and the constant
                guilt of calling people back two days late.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hiring a receptionist solves the phone problem at the
                exact wrong cost. A part-time hire is $1,800-$2,400/month
more than the average solo operator's monthly software
                stack, for 20 hours of coverage. Even if the math worked,
                a one-person business doesn't have the bandwidth to manage
                a part-time employee on top of everything else.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implenix is built for exactly this profile. It sits as
                your virtual front desk: picks up every inbound call
                within one ring, runs your tuned intake script, books
                appointments against your calendar, captures leads to
                your CRM, and transfers calls to your mobile only when
                your rules say to interrupt. Coverage is 24/7. Cost is
                $297/month flat. Setup takes 7-14 days and requires no
                technical work on your end. For most solo operators,
                this is the highest-leverage subscription you'll add to
                the business.
