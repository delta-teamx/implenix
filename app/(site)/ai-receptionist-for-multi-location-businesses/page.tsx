    question: 'How does the AI route calls across multiple locations?',
    answer:
      'Geofenced routing by area code or zip lookup. The agent identifies the caller\'s service area on the first turn and routes to the right location\'s schedule, dispatch, and team, with brand-consistent intake across all of them.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can each location have its own script and schedule?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We tune per-location overrides on top of a shared brand script, service hours, capacity rules, on-call rotations, holiday schedules. Brand consistency stays; operational specifics flex per location.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does reporting work across locations?',
    answer:
      'Per-location dashboards plus a roll-up. Call volume, capture rate, booking rate, and revenue attribution split by location. Operations and ownership both see the data they need.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about franchises with separate ownership per location?',
    answer:
      'Supported. Each franchisee can have its own CRM, calendar, and dispatch integration on the same brand-consistent agent. Centralized standards, decentralized operations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does multi-location deployment take?',
    answer:
      '14-28 business days depending on location count and per-location customization. The shared brand script is built once; per-location config layers on after.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What plan tier is required for multi-location?',
    answer:
      'The Established Firm tier ($997/month) supports unlimited inbound calls and multi-location routing. Larger operations (15+ locations) typically work on a custom enterprise quote.',

              <p>
                Multi-location operations face an unusual phone
                challenge: the brand wants consistent intake across
                every location (same voice, same qualification, same
                customer experience), but each location has different
                operational specifics (service hours, capacity, on-call
                rotations, dispatch tools). Most businesses end up
                picking one and losing the other, either every
                location runs its own front desk with drift in
                experience, or a centralized call center loses the
                operational nuance each location needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implenix is built to handle both. The shared brand
                script, voice, qualification logic, transfer rules,
                customer experience, runs across every location. On
                top of that, per-location config layers in: service
                hours, capacity rules, holiday schedules, on-call
                rotations, location-specific transfer rules, and
                location-specific CRM and dispatch integrations.
                Geofenced routing identifies the caller's service area
                on the first turn and routes accordingly, no menu, no
                "press 1 for Boston, press 2 for Chicago."
              </p>
              <p>
                Reporting follows the same shape: per-location
                dashboards visible to that location's manager, plus a
                roll-up dashboard for ownership showing capture rate,
                booking rate, and revenue attribution split across
                every location. Multi-location operations on Implenix
                typically see consistent capture rates above 90% across
                all locations, vs the 50-70% range typical for
                operations without centralized intake handling.
