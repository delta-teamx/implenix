    '12 measurable benefits of an AI receptionist — cost savings, capture rate, after-hours coverage, real ROI math, with backing numbers from deployments.',

const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'What is the biggest benefit of an AI receptionist?',
    answer:
      'For most local businesses, it is recovered missed-call pipeline. The typical SMB loses $5,000–$30,000/month to unanswered calls; the AI captures most of that at fixed cost. The cost reduction vs hiring is also substantial but secondary to the lost-revenue recovery.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the ROI actually measurable?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Booking volume, after-hours capture rate, response time, no-show rate, and revenue attribution all flow back through your CRM and reporting. Most businesses see net-positive ROI within 30 days of go-live.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can a small business benefit from this?',
    answer:
      'Especially small businesses. Solo operators and small teams gain the most because their bottleneck is their own phone time. The AI runs the routine work so the owner can do the actual job.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about the human element — does that get lost?',
    answer:
      'Live transfer rules route the calls that genuinely need human warmth to a real person in real time. The AI handles the 80–90% of routine inbound where speed and consistency matter more than empathy.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do these benefits compare across industries?',
    answer:
      'The shape is consistent: lost-pipeline recovery, after-hours capture, reduced labor on phone, faster response time. The magnitude varies — high-ticket industries (law, mortgage, real estate) see larger dollar gains; high-volume industries (HVAC, dental, salons) see larger time savings.',
  },

              <p>
                The benefits of an AI receptionist break into four buckets,
                and the relative size of each varies by industry. The first
                bucket is recovered pipeline — the missed-call cost that
                stops happening once every inbound is answered. For most
                local businesses this is the biggest dollar number on the
                page, often $5,000-$30,000/month in lost revenue that
                returns to the business inside the first month of go-live.
                The second bucket is labor — front-desk, dispatcher, and
                owner hours that stop being spent on routine phone work and
                go back into the business.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third bucket is capability you did not have before: 24/7
                coverage, unlimited concurrent calls, multi-language
                support, real-time CRM sync, configurable handoff rules.
                These are not just cost savings — they are net-new
                operating capacity. The fourth bucket is compliance and
                consistency: every call recorded and transcribed, every
                lead captured the same way, no operator drift between
                shifts, no training overhead. For regulated industries
                this bucket is large; for everyone else it shows up as
                fewer "I forgot to log that one" losses.
