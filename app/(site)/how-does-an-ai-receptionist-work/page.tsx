    'How an AI receptionist works step-by-step: voice AI, telephony, NLU, calendar booking, CRM sync, and live transfer. The full call lifecycle explained.',
  path: '/how-does-an-ai-receptionist-work',
});

const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'How does an AI receptionist actually answer a call?',
    answer:
      'When a call lands on your business number, it routes through telephony infrastructure (typically a SIP trunk) into the voice AI. The agent picks up, plays the greeting, and starts listening. Speech-to-text converts the caller\'s words to text in real time, the language model classifies intent and extracts entities, and the response generator picks the next prompt from your defined script.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What technology does it use?',
    answer:
      'Conversational voice AI (text-to-speech and speech-to-text), natural language understanding for intent and entity extraction, telephony (SIP) for call routing, and APIs for two-way integration with your CRM and calendar. Modern systems use streaming audio so latency feels natural, under 800ms turn-taking.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does it know what to say?',
    answer:
      'During onboarding, your team works with us to tune the call script, voice, qualification logic, and transfer rules. The agent follows that defined dialogue tree at runtime, it does not freelance answers. For questions outside the defined script, it transfers to a human or follows a fallback rule.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does it book appointments live?',
    answer:
      'The agent makes an API call to your calendar (Google, Outlook, Calendly, or your industry PMS) during the conversation, reads back the next available slots, and writes the booking with full intake context once the caller confirms. The customer gets an SMS or email confirmation before the call ends.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does it handle CRM sync?',
    answer:
      'Two-way API integration. During the call, the agent looks up the contact (if known) and writes the call event, transcript, recording URL, and outcome to the CRM record. After the call, follow-up tasks or pipeline stage changes happen automatically per your rules.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does live transfer work?',
    answer:
      'Defined rules trigger transfers, VIP allow-list, urgent keywords, frustration detection (sentiment + tone), or specific intent classes. The agent says "let me get the right person" and warm-transfers the call to your team or backup human service via SIP within seconds.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after the call ends?',
    answer:
      'The recording uploads to storage, the transcript finalizes, the contact and outcome write to your CRM, and any follow-up actions trigger (booking confirmation, reminder sequence, escalation queue). Reporting aggregates everything for your dashboard.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does setup take?',
    answer:
      '7 to 14 business days for most deployments. The work splits across script tuning, voice selection, integration setup, transfer rule definition, and a parallel-test phase before cutting over real traffic.',
