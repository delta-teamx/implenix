    intro:
      "An AI receptionist is dedicated phone infrastructure that answers a business's inbound calls in real time, follows a custom script tuned for the business, qualifies callers against defined rules, books appointments against the calendar, and writes the outcome back to the CRM. Where a human receptionist handles one call at a time during their shift, an AI receptionist handles unlimited concurrent calls 24 hours a day at fixed cost. The category emerged because most local businesses, agencies, and professional firms lose meaningful pipeline to missed calls, voicemail loses 75% of callers outright, and hiring is expensive enough that most businesses cover only 40 hours of the week's 168. AI receptionists fill the niche by combining voice AI, telephony, and integrations into a deployed agent that practically replaces the front-desk role for routine work while still routing the calls that need a human to one in real time.",

      "Voice AI refers to AI systems that produce or understand spoken language in real time. The category combines several distinct technologies: automatic speech recognition (ASR or speech-to-text) converts a caller's spoken audio into text; natural language understanding classifies the text into intents and extracts entities; a language model or dialogue manager picks the appropriate response; text-to-speech synthesis generates the spoken response back. Modern voice AI runs the full loop with sub-800ms turn-taking, fast enough that the conversation feels natural to the caller. The technology underlies AI receptionists, AI voice agents in customer support, and increasingly any business application where a phone call replaces a chat or form. Voice AI is distinct from older speech technology (IVRs, simple speech menus) because it produces flexible conversational output rather than constrained menu navigation, and because it integrates with downstream systems (CRMs, calendars, dispatch tools) to take action during the conversation rather than just collecting information.",

Call routing predates AI receptionists, traditional PBXs and IVRs implement basic routing through extension menus, but AI receptionists make routing significantly more powerful because the routing logic can use the full content of the conversation rather than just static caller attributes.

Front-end lead qualification, capturing the same data on the inbound call before a salesperson is involved, is one of the highest-leverage uses of an AI receptionist.

The economics of after-hours coverage are surprisingly important. Roughly 30-50% of bookings on a deployed AI receptionist come from outside business hours. After-hours emergencies (HVAC outages, plumbing leaks, vet emergencies, urgent legal matters) cannot wait until morning, the first business to answer wins the job. Voicemail loses 75% of after-hours callers outright. Live answering services charge premium rates (typically 2-3x daytime per-minute) for after-hours coverage.

The economics depend on average client value and conversion rates: at $1,500 average client value and a 20% conversion rate on returned calls, every missed call represents roughly $300 of expected pipeline. For a business missing 60 calls a week, that is roughly $18,000 per week, $936,000 per year, of recoverable pipeline.

In a modern AI receptionist, NLU runs on every conversational turn, the model classifies the most recent caller utterance against the defined intent set and pulls out any new entity values. The dialogue manager then uses the classification to branch the script: a book_appointment intent goes to the booking flow, an emergency intent triggers urgent-criteria routing, a transfer-to-human request triggers a warm transfer.

It is the modern equivalent of a traditional analog or digital phone line: instead of physical wiring to a telephone exchange, a SIP trunk routes calls through an IP network to and from a SIP-capable endpoint. SIP trunks are the foundation of modern telephony and the integration layer that makes AI receptionists possible. When a caller dials a business number, the call routes from the caller\'s carrier to the SIP trunk, which delivers it to the AI receptionist endpoint as a streaming audio session. The agent answers, runs the call, and either holds the call to completion or warm-transfers it to a human via another SIP leg. SIP also handles outbound calls (for AI follow-up sequences) and conference bridges (for multi-party calls).

      "IVR defined: menu-based phone systems that route callers via 'press 1 for sales.' Why customers hate it and how AI replaces it.",
    intro:
      'IVR (Interactive Voice Response) refers to menu-based phone systems that route callers by DTMF (touch-tone) digit selection or simple speech recognition, the familiar "press 1 for sales, press 2 for support" experience. IVR predates modern voice AI by several decades and remains widespread because it is cheap and predictable. It is also universally hated by callers, multiple studies consistently put IVR among the worst customer-service experiences across industries, with hangup rates frequently above 50%. IVR exists for one core reason: routing inbound calls to the right human or queue. It does not book appointments, qualify leads, or capture intake, those tasks fall to whoever picks up after the IVR finishes. AI receptionists supersede IVR by replacing the menu with an actual conversation, classifying intent from natural language rather than digit selection, and resolving the request directly (booking, intake, transfer) rather than just routing. For most local businesses, an AI receptionist replaces an IVR plus a receptionist plus voicemail with one system.',
