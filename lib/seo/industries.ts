    intro:
      "Medical practices live and die by the front desk. New-patient intake calls land while staff is checking in the patient already standing at the counter. Insurance verification calls eat hours. Refill requests pile up on hold. The result is the same every time: high-intent callers hit voicemail, then call the practice down the street that picked up. Implenix takes that pressure off. The AI receptionist for medical practices answers every inbound call within one ring, runs your intake script, verifies insurance against the questions you define, and books the appointment directly into your PMS. It distinguishes between a new patient request, a refill question, an insurance issue, and a true clinical concern — and routes each one according to rules your team approves. Refills go to the queue your nurse already monitors. Clinical questions transfer live. Cold solicitations get screened. Everything else gets booked. After every call, the contact is updated, the recording is archived, and the next-step notification goes out. Practices that switch see new-patient capture rates jump from the typical 45-55% to above 90% inside the first month. Front desk staff stop drowning. Providers stop walking out at 6 PM to a stack of voicemail. And the practice stops losing six-figure pipeline to a phone system that wasn't designed for the volume.",

    intro:
      "Electricians lose money to two things they cannot control with their hands full: power-out calls at 2 AM and estimate calls during the workday. Both share the same problem — the phone rings while everyone capable of answering is on a roof, in a panel, or driving between sites. Voicemail is an instant lost job for a panel replacement, a generator install, or an emergency outage. Implenix is the AI receptionist for electricians: it picks up inside one ring, triages residential vs commercial, sorts emergencies from estimate requests, and books the right tech to the right window — all written back to your dispatch software before the next call comes in. The agent runs the intake script your team would run if they had time: address, age of panel, scope of work, urgency, accepted payment. For storm-driven outage spikes, it scales without overtime. For routine bid calls, it captures specs in detail your tech can actually act on. And for the calls that should reach a human — a long-time commercial client, a complex bid over a threshold, or a frustrated caller — it transfers live within seconds. Electricians who deploy Implenix typically see emergency-call capture climb from the low 40s to above 90 percent within the first month, and crews report fewer on-site surprises because intake quality is consistent across every call.",

      "A general contractor's pipeline is built from phone calls that arrive at the worst possible time — mid-pour, on a ladder, in a meeting with a sub.

Implenix is the AI receptionist for contractors: it answers every inbound call inside one ring, qualifies the lead by project type, scope, budget range, and timeline, and books the site visit directly into your calendar. The questions match what you would ask if you had time — square footage, design status, permit posture, financing readiness, decision-makers involved. Real estate agents and homeowners get a different intake than commercial property managers. Sub coordination calls, change-order questions, and inspector follow-ups route to the people who can actually answer. The agent screens out tire-kickers (no permit, no decision-maker, no realistic budget) so your project manager only sees calls worth a site visit. After every call, the lead lands in your CRM with full context, photos collected via SMS, and a follow-up scheduled. Contractors deploying Implenix tend to see qualified site-visit volume rise 40-60% in the first quarter while their PMs report fewer wasted truck rolls because the intake quality stays consistent across every call.",

Each missed call is a $80-$250 service that booked somewhere else. Implenix is the AI receptionist for salons: it answers every inbound inside one ring, books directly into Boulevard, Vagaro, Mindbody, or whatever you run, respects stylist availability and capacity rules, and reduces no-shows with multi-touch reminder calls. Specific stylist requests get matched against the booking calendar — the agent will not book Maria for an appointment when she's already double-booked. New-client intake captures referral source, hair history, and product allergies. Group bookings and bridal parties get routed to your senior coordinator. Reschedules and cancellations happen live without staff involvement. Walk-ins still get the personal touch from your front desk. Salons that ship Implenix typically reclaim 15-20 hours per week per front-desk team member and watch no-show rates drop 25-30% inside the first quarter. The chair stays full.

Every call answered by an associate is billable hours not earned. Every call missed is a prospect filing somewhere else. Implenix is the AI receptionist for accountants: it answers every inbound inside one ring, runs your client intake script, captures business structure, prior preparer, document readiness, and entity complexity, then books the right service tier into the right partner's calendar. Existing clients get fast-path routing — name and SSN last-four lookup pulls them out of the new-client queue and into status-check or document-request handling. Document collection happens via SMS or secure portal links the agent sends mid-call. Engagement-letter status, e-file confirmations, and IRS notice handling each have their own intake script. Cold calls and tax-software solicitations get screened. The result: associates stay billable, partners only see qualified consults, and the firm captures 40-60% more new-business calls during peak season without hiring temporary staff. Off-season, the agent stays warm, handling year-round tax planning and bookkeeping intake without paying for capacity you do not need.",

    intro:
      "Marketing agencies have a unique phone problem: most inbound calls are either six-figure RFPs or someone trying to sell you SEO. The cost of mis-routing those is asymmetric. The wrong filter sends a great-fit RFP to voicemail and forwards a cold pitch to your founder. Most agencies handle this by routing everything to a junior account person — which means the RFP either gets a generic response or sits in a queue for two days. By then, the prospect has talked to three other agencies. Implenix is the AI receptionist for marketing agencies: it answers every inbound inside one ring, runs RFP qualification (industry, budget range, timeline, existing-vendor status, decision-maker confirmation), and either books a discovery call directly into your founder or strategy lead's calendar or sends a polite no-thanks to anything below your minimum bar. Cold pitches and vendor solicitations get screened. Existing-client account questions route to the right account team in real time. Press and partnership inquiries route to your comms team. The agent learns your service tiers and minimum project size, so an inquiry for a $5K logo never lands on a calendar built for $250K retainers. After every qualified call, the lead lands in HubSpot or whatever you run with full context — including a recording your business development lead can listen to before the discovery call.",

      "A cleaning company runs on recurring revenue and tight scheduling. Your dispatcher is juggling key handoffs, gate codes, parking instructions, and the customer who wants to add a deep clean to next Thursday's appointment — all while the phone rings off the hook with new-customer calls. Most cleaning operators handle this by running their phone through a single dispatcher who picks up when she can. Half the time she cannot. Implenix is the AI receptionist for cleaning services: it answers every inbound inside one ring, books one-time and recurring jobs against your real availability, captures square footage / bathroom count / pet info / access instructions, and handles routine schedule changes without involving your dispatcher. New-customer intake captures the questions that actually matter — frequency, scope, surfaces, allergens — so your crew shows up ready. Recurring customers get fast-path identification: caller ID matches an active account, the agent skips intake and goes straight to schedule changes or add-ons. Commercial accounts with SLAs route to your account manager. Cancellations write back live so the slot reopens. The result: cleaning operators reclaim 12-15 hours per week of dispatcher phone time, capture 30-40% more after-hours bookings, and stop losing recurring customers to operational friction. The crew shows up to clean, not to apologize.",

Each one is high-stakes, and each one loses if it sits in voicemail. Implenix is the AI receptionist for mortgage brokers: it answers every inbound within one ring, qualifies rate-shoppers (loan amount, property type, credit posture, timeline) before they reach a loan officer, and routes existing-client questions through caller-verified fast-path. Pre-approval letter requests from Realtors get same-day priority routing. Document collection happens via secure SMS portal links the agent sends mid-call — borrowers stop saying \"I emailed it\" and the LO stops chasing missing pages. Compliance-sensitive intake follows your defined scripts so your team is not freelancing on disclosure language. After every call, the lead lands in your LOS or CRM with full context — including a recording the LO can review before calling back. Brokers who deploy Implenix typically cut LO phone time by 12-18 hours per week while qualified pre-approval volume climbs 40-50%, and Realtor partners stop dropping referrals because the broker is now the fastest call back in the market.",

Instead, they are intaking auto claims at 7 PM. Implenix is the AI receptionist for insurance agents: it answers every inbound within one ring, runs your quote intake script, routes claim calls into your defined claim-intake path, and handles routine policy questions without producer involvement. Quote intake captures the data your producers actually need — driver count, vehicles, drivers' age, coverage limits, prior carrier — so the producer's first callback is a real conversation, not a fact-finding mission. Existing-policyholders get caller-verified fast-path: name and policy number look up the account, and the agent answers most billing/policy/coverage questions directly from your AMS. Claim intake follows your carrier's required script and routes to the right adjuster path. After-hours claim calls do not hit voicemail — they get full intake. The result: agencies cut producer phone time by 15-20 hours per week, capture 35-45% more after-hours quote requests, and stop losing renewal customers to the agency that picks up faster.",

    intro:
      "A veterinary practice handles three call types in the same queue: anxious pet parents calling about something that might be an emergency, routine wellness/booking calls, and prescription/food refill requests. The mix is brutal because every caller thinks their call is the urgent one — and one of them really is. Voicemail is not an option for a vet. A pet parent who hits voicemail when their dog is bloating drives to the emergency clinic across town and never comes back. Implenix is the AI receptionist for veterinarians: it answers every inbound within one ring, triages emergencies against your defined urgent-criteria list (bloating, seizures, ingestion, breathing trouble, hit-by-car, large-breed limp), and routes them straight to your on-call line or the nearest emergency partner. Routine wellness bookings happen live against your PIMS schedule. Refill requests follow your in-house pharmacy or online formulary path. New-client intake captures species, breed, age, vaccine history, prior vet, and reason for visit before the appointment is booked. After hours, urgent triage stays live; non-urgent goes into a callback queue your tech reviews first thing. The agent's tone is warm — it knows pet parents are scared. Practices that deploy Implenix typically cut tech and front-desk phone time 15-20 hours per week, see no-show rates drop 25-30% with proactive confirmations, and stop losing emergency triage to the urgent-care across the street.",

    intro:
      "Chiropractic practices have a particular phone problem: the busy hours on the phone are the same hours the doctor is in adjustments. New-patient calls land at 11 AM when the entire team is mid-treatment. Existing-patient reschedules pile up. Insurance authorization questions follow a script the front desk could handle in their sleep — except they are not at the desk, they are running the table. Implenix is the AI receptionist for chiropractors: it answers every inbound within one ring, books new-patient intake with insurance pre-screening (carrier, member ID, prior auth, treatment history), handles existing-patient reschedules live, and routes anything clinical to the doctor's callback queue. Recurring patients on care plans get fast-path identification — name and DOB lookup pulls them out of the new-patient queue. Insurance auth questions follow your verification script. Treatment-plan upgrades and re-exams route to the appropriate path. The result: chiropractors capture 30-40% more new-patient bookings without hiring a second front-desk staff, no-show rates drop 20-25% with proactive confirmations, and the doctor stops walking into the next adjustment behind because someone needed to take a phone call. Treatment time stays treatment time.",

      "Therapists have the most sensitive phone problem in any service business. Every new-client call is someone reaching out, often after a long pause. Voicemail can break that thread permanently. Existing clients sometimes call in moments of crisis. Insurance and sliding-scale questions are emotionally loaded. Yet most therapy practices route their phone through the same provider who is in session 25 hours a week. Implenix is the AI receptionist for therapists: it answers every inbound within one ring with a warm, screened voice, runs your new-client intake (presenting concern, insurance / sliding-scale, prior therapy, geographic location, modality preference), and books only when your practice rules allow. Crisis-keyword detection routes self-harm and acute-distress callers directly to your defined crisis path — your warm-line, an on-call clinician, or 988 — within seconds, never to voicemail. Existing-client questions about scheduling, copay, or telehealth links resolve without disrupting your session schedule. Sliding-scale conversations follow your stated policy without freelancing. After-hours, urgent triage stays live; non-urgent goes into a callback queue your office manager handles first thing. The tone matches the field. The intake is consistent. And the provider keeps their session hours protected, which is the whole point.",
